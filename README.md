"The tech stack for our project, 'booking web,' is a combination of front-end and back-end technologies designed to create a robust and user-friendly hotel booking web application. Our tech stack is divided into the following components."
<br>Front-End:
"For the front-end, we used React.js, a powerful JavaScript library for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces. React.js allowed us to create a seamless user experience for registering, logging in, selecting destination cities, and filtering hotels based on price range."
<br>Back-End:
"The back-end of our application was developed as a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js. Node.js provided a highly efficient runtime environment, and Express.js facilitated route handling, middleware management, and seamless communication between the front-end and database."
